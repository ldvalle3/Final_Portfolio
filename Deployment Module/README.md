High-Level Overview of the Deployment Module Purpose
Users
The users for the deployment module are the development team and operations responsible for ensuring the application is built, tested, and deployed efficiently with minimal downtime or manual intervention.

Job It Performs for Users
The deployment module automates and streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying the application, making it:

Easier to maintain consistent deployment practices.
More reliable with automated test coverage ensuring quality.
Faster by removing manual processes through continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Inspiration
The inspiration for implementing the deployment module was to ensure that updates to the yoga sequencing application could be released quickly, reliably, and with confidence. With continuous integration and automated testing, I wanted to eliminate errors during deployment and reduce the manual overhead of managing builds.

Most Important Features
Automated Builds: Ensures the latest code is compiled and built automatically upon pushing changes.
Testing Processes: Run tests automatically as part of the CI pipeline, ensuring quality control.
Deployment Automations: Automatically deploys the application after passing tests.
Test Coverage: Includes code coverage checks to ensure tests are comprehensive.
Versioning & Tagging: Ensures that releases are tagged and versioned properly, improving release management.
STAR Interview Framework
(Situation)
Managing application deployments manually can lead to errors, delays, and inconsistent deployments. To address this, I built an automated deployment module for the yoga sequencing application, ensuring builds, tests, and deployments are handled seamlessly.

(Task)
My task was to integrate automated processes into the application's deployment cycle. This involved setting up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows, automating the testing, versioning, and deployment process to improve efficiency.

(Action)
Set up automated builds that trigger every time code is pushed to the repository.
Integrated automated testing processes to ensure all code changes are validated with unit tests and integration tests.
Configured deployment automation so that once the tests pass, the application is deployed automatically.
Used versioning and tagging to label releases and ensure proper management of application versions.
(Result)
The deployment module has significantly streamlined the release process for the yoga sequencing application. Now, each deployment is automatic, tested, and versioned, reducing the risk of errors and manual mistakes, while also speeding up the release cycle.

Technologies Used
Deployment Tools
GitHub Actions: Used for continuous integration and deployment automation, ensuring the entire process from build to deployment is automated.
Docker: For containerization of the app, making deployments consistent across different environments.
Heroku/Netlify: Used for deploying both the front-end and back-end of the application.
Testing Tools
Jest: v27.x (for unit and integration testing)
Cypress: v8.x (for end-to-end testing)
Versioning & Tagging
SemVer (Semantic Versioning) for proper version numbering and change tracking.
GitHub Release Tags for version management.
Other Dependencies
ESLint: v8.x (for code linting to ensure code quality)
Prettier: v2.x (for automatic code formatting)
