High-Level Overview of the Front-End Module Purpose
Users
The primary users of this module are yoga instructors who interact with the application to design, customize, and manage yoga sequences visually.

Job It Performs for Users
The front-end module simplifies the sequence-building process with:

An intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create yoga flows effortlessly.
A reorganized pose library for quick and easy access to yoga poses.
Enhanced interactivity and smooth transitions for better user engagement.
Inspiration
The inspiration came from the need to provide yoga instructors with a user-friendly tool to build sequences without technical hurdles. The focus was to minimize friction and maximize creative freedom, ensuring they could focus on the content of their classes rather than the tool itself.

Most Important Features
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Enables users to create sequences visually by dragging poses into the desired order.
Pose Library: A reorganized and categorized library for quicker navigation and selection of poses.
Dynamic JavaScript Integration: Enhances user interactions, offering a responsive and engaging experience.
STAR Interview Framework
(Situation)
Yoga instructors often use generic or manual tools to design their sequences, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. To address this, I developed a front-end module with interactive features tailored for creating yoga flows.

(Task)
My goal was to build a highly interactive and visually intuitive module for the yoga sequencing application. I aimed to make the user experience seamless and ensure the module complemented the backend features, focusing on usability and responsiveness.

(Action)
Used JavaScript to integrate dynamic functionality, ensuring smooth interactions.
Designed and implemented a drag-and-drop interface to allow users to build sequences visually.
Reorganized the pose library into logical categories for faster pose selection.
Emphasized responsive design to ensure the application works across devices and screen sizes.
(Result)
The updated front-end module significantly improved the user experience, allowing yoga instructors to quickly create and customize sequences with minimal effort. The drag-and-drop functionality and reorganized pose library received positive feedback for their ease of use.
