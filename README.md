 ## Portfolio Introduction
  Hey my name is Lissette Valle and I first started my career in the world of science. I would say the closest thing that I would categorize myself as is a multipotentiolite. Which essentially means that I am passionate about way too many things. Although somehow I feel like all of my pursuits have led to this very endeavor as a Software Engineer. I studied biochemistry in college because I've always always navigated with a curious mind. I also constanty had art projects on the side which involved anything I could get my hands on. What has always motivated me is the endless avenues of learning certain career paths offered. Although I loved to do all these activities individually I never knew there was a path that could integrate everything that I love. Then I found software engineering.
   My artistic background has honed my creativity, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills, while my science education has fostered a logical, analytical mindset and a curiosity to understand how things work. This combination of creativity and logic naturally led me to software engineering, where Iâ€™ve discovered the perfect way to blend these strengths by crafting innovative solutions and designing efficient, elegant code.

## Project Overviews 

All my projects were an expansion of my final project done in the Multiverse Bootcamp. This was an application build as a platform for yoga instructors to ceate yoga sequences. I created a library of yog poses and allows the users to grab any pose and create sequences that they are then able to save. As a yoga instructor myself I was very passionate abut creating a product that could actually be useful in my everyday life. 

### Front end project 

For my front end module I infused javascript integration, added a drag and drop interface, and reorganized my pose library.
