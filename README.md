  # Portfolio Introduction
  Hey my name is Lissette Valle and I first started my career in the world of science. I would say the closest thing that I would categorize myself as is a multipotentiolite. Which essentially means that I am passionate about way too many things. Although somehow I feel like all of my pursuits have led to this very endeavor as a Software Engineer. I studied biochemistry in college because I've always always navigated with a curious mind. I also constanty had art projects on the side which involved anything I could get my hands on. What has always motivated me is the endless avenues of learning certain career paths offered. Although I loved to do all these activities individually I never knew there was a path that could integrate everything that I love. Then I found software engineering.
  I allows me to express my logical side as well as my creative side. At AirDNA I was able to work as a fullstack engineer.
